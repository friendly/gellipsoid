# gellipsoid

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The gellipsoid package extends the class of ellipsoids to "generalized ellipsoids" to degenerate ellipsoids that are flat and/or unbounded. Thus, ellipsoids can be naturally defined to include lines, hyperplanes, points, cylinders, etc.
The methods can be used to represent generalized ellipsoids in a $d$-dimensional space
$\mathcal{R}^d$, with plots in up to 3D.

<!-- The motivation for this more general representation is to allow a notation for a class of generalized ellipsoids -->
<!-- that is algebraically closed under -->

The goal is to be able to think about, visualize, and compute a linear transformation of an ellipsoid with central matrix
$\mathbf{C}$ or its inverse $\mathbf{C}^{-1}$ which apply equally to unbounded and/or degenerate ellipsoids.

The implementation uses a $(\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{D})$ representation,
based on the singular value decomposition (SVD)
of an ellipsoid-generating matrix, $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{V}^{T}$,
where $\mathbf{U}$ is square orthogonal and $\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal.
For the usual, "proper" ellipsoids, $\mathbf{A}$ is positive-definite so all elements of $\mathbf{D}$ are positive.
In generalized ellipsoids, $\mathbf{D}$ is extended to non-negative real numbers, i.e. 
its elements can be 0, Inf or a positive real.

#### Definitions

A _proper_ ellipsoid in $\mathcal{R}^d$ can be defined by $\mathcal{E := {x : x^T \mathbf{C} x \le 1 }}$
where $\mathbf{C}$ is a non-negative definite central matrix, 
In applications, $\mathbf{C}$ is typically a variance-covariance matrix
A proper ellipsoid is _bounded_, with a non-empty interior.
We call these **fat** ellipsoids.

A degenerate _flat_ ellipsoid corresponds to one where the central matrix $\mathbf{C}$ is singular
or when there are one or more zero singular values in $\mathbf{D}$.
In 3D, a generalized ellipsoid that is flat in one dimension 
($\mathbf{D} = \mathrm{diag} {X, X, 0}$) collapses to an ellipse;
one that is flat in two dimensions ($\mathbf{D} = \mathrm{diag} {X, 0, 0}$)
collapses to a line, and one that is flat in three dimensions collapses to a point.

An _unbounded_ ellipsoid is one that has infinite extent in one or more directions,
and is characterized by infinite singular values in $\mathbf{D}}.
for example, in 3D, an unbounded ellipsoid with one infinite singular value is
an infinite cylinder of elliptical cross-section.

## Principal functions

* `gell()` Constructs a generalized ellipsoid using the $(\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{D})$ representation. The
inputs can be specified in a variety of ways:
  + a non-negative definite variance matrix;
  + an inner-product matrix
  + a subspace with a given span
  + a matrix giving a linear transformation of the unit sphere
  
* `dual()` calculates the dual or inverse of a generalized ellipsoid
* `gmult()` calculates a linear transformation of a generalized ellipsoid
* `signature()` calculates the signature of a generalized ellipsoid, a vector of length 3 giving the number of positive, zero and infinite singular values in the (U, D) representation.


* `ell3d()` Plots generalized ellipsoids in 3D using the `rgl` package

## Installation

You can install the development version of gellipsoid from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("friendly/gellipsoid")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(gellipsoid)
## basic example code
```


<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->


The following figure shows views of two generalized ellipsoids.
$C_1$ (blue) determines a proper, fat ellipsoid; it's inverse $C_1^{-1}$ also generates a proper ellipsoid.
$C_2$ (red) determines an improper, fat ellipsoid, whose inverse $C_2^{-1}$ is an unbounded cylinder of elliptical
cross-section.
$C_2$ is the projection of $C_1$ onto the plane where $z = 0$.
The scale of these ellipsoids is defined by the gray unit sphere.
