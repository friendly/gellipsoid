<!-- badges: end -->

The gellipsoid package extends the class of ellipsoids to ‚Äúgeneralized
ellipsoids‚Äù, which are degenerate ellipsoids that are flat and/or
unbounded. Thus, ellipsoids can be naturally defined to include lines,
hyperplanes, points, cylinders, etc. The methods can be used to
represent generalized ellipsoids in a *d*-dimensional space
‚Ñõ<sup>*d*</sup>, with plots in up to 3D.

<!-- The motivation for this more general representation is to allow a notation for a class of generalized ellipsoids -->
<!-- that is algebraically closed under -->

The goal is to be able to think about, visualize, and compute a linear
transformation of an ellipsoid with central matrix **C** or its inverse
**C**<sup>‚àí1</sup> which apply equally to unbounded and/or degenerate
ellipsoids.

The implementation uses a (**U**,**D**) representation, based on the
singular value decomposition (SVD) of an ellipsoid-generating matrix,
**A**‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ**U****D****V**<sup>*T*</sup>, where **U** is square orthogonal
and **D** is diagonal. For the usual, ‚Äúproper‚Äù ellipsoids, **A** is
positive-definite so all elements of **D** are positive. In generalized
ellipsoids, **D** is extended to non-negative real numbers, i.e.¬† its
elements can be 0, Inf or a positive real.

#### Definitions

A *proper* ellipsoid in ‚Ñõ<sup>*d*</sup> can be defined by
‚Ñ∞‚ÄÑ:=‚ÄÑ{ùìç‚ÄÑ:‚ÄÑùìç<sup>ùíØ</sup>**C**ùìç‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑ1} where **C** is a non-negative
definite central matrix, In applications, **C** is typically a
variance-covariance matrix A proper ellipsoid is *bounded*, with a
non-empty interior. We call these **fat** ellipsoids.

A degenerate *flat* ellipsoid corresponds to one where the central
matrix **C** is singular or when there are one or more zero singular
values in **D**. In 3D, a generalized ellipsoid that is flat in one
dimension (**D**‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑdiag{*X*,‚ÄÜ*X*,‚ÄÜ0}) collapses to an ellipse; one that
is flat in two dimensions (**D**‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑdiag{*X*,‚ÄÜ0,‚ÄÜ0}) collapses to a line,
and one that is flat in three dimensions collapses to a point.

An *unbounded* ellipsoid is one that has infinite extent in one or more
directions, and is characterized by infinite singular values in **D**.
For example, in 3D, an unbounded ellipsoid with one infinite singular
value is an infinite cylinder of elliptical cross-section.

## Principal functions

-   `gell()` Constructs a generalized ellipsoid using the (**U**,**D**)
    representation. The inputs can be specified in a variety of ways:

    -   a non-negative definite variance matrix;
    -   an inner-product matrix
    -   a subspace with a given span
    -   a matrix giving a linear transformation of the unit sphere

-   `dual()` calculates the dual or inverse of a generalized ellipsoid

-   `gmult()` calculates a linear transformation of a generalized
    ellipsoid

-   `signature()` calculates the signature of a generalized ellipsoid, a
    vector of length 3 giving the number of positive, zero and infinite
    singular values in the (U, D) representation.

-   `ell3d()` Plots generalized ellipsoids in 3D using the `rgl` package

## Installation

You can install the development version of gellipsoid from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```

## Example

#### Properties of generalized ellipsoids

The following examples illustrate `gell` objects and their properties.
Each of these may be plotted in 3D using `ell3d()`. These objects can be
specified in a variety of ways, but for these examples the span is
simplest.

A unit sphere in *R*<sup>3</sup> has a central matrix of the identity
matrix.

``` r
library(gellipsoid)
(zsph <- gell(diag(3)))  # a unit sphere in R^3
#> $center
#> [1] 0 0 0
#> 
#> $u
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    0    0    1
#> [2,]    0    1    0
#> [3,]    1    0    0
#> 
#> $d
#> [1] 1 1 1
#> 
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "gell"
signature(zsph)
#>  pos zero  inf 
#>    3    0    0
isBounded(zsph)
#> [1] TRUE
isFlat(zsph)
#> [1] FALSE
```

A plane in *R*<sup>3</sup> is flat in one dimension.

``` r
(zplane <- gell(span = diag(3)[, 1:2]))  # a plane
#> $center
#> [1] 0 0 0
#> 
#> $u
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    1    0    0
#> [2,]    0    1    0
#> [3,]    0    0    1
#> 
#> $d
#> [1] Inf Inf   0
#> 
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "gell"
signature(zplane)
#>  pos zero  inf 
#>    0    1    2
isBounded(zplane)
#> [1] FALSE
isFlat(zplane)
#> [1] TRUE

dual(zplane)  # line orthogonal to that plane
#> $center
#> [1] 0 0 0
#> 
#> $u
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    0    0    1
#> [2,]    0    1    0
#> [3,]    1    0    0
#> 
#> $d
#> [1] Inf   0   0
#> 
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "gell"
signature(dual(zplane))
#>  pos zero  inf 
#>    0    2    1
```

A hyperplane. Note that the `gell` object with a center contains more
information than the geometric plane.

``` r
(zhplane <- gell(center = c(0, 0, 2), 
                 span = diag(3)[, 1:2]))  # a hyperplane
#> $center
#> [1] 0 0 2
#> 
#> $u
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    1    0    0
#> [2,]    0    1    0
#> [3,]    0    0    1
#> 
#> $d
#> [1] Inf Inf   0
#> 
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "gell"
signature(zhplane)
#>  pos zero  inf 
#>    0    1    2

dual(zhplane)  # orthogonal line through same center
#> $center
#> [1] 0 0 2
#> 
#> $u
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    0    0    1
#> [2,]    0    1    0
#> [3,]    1    0    0
#> 
#> $d
#> [1] Inf   0   0
#> 
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "gell"
```

A point:

``` r
zorigin <- gell(span = cbind(c(0, 0, 0)))
signature(zorigin)
#>  pos zero  inf 
#>    0    3    0

# what is the dual (inverse) of a point?
dual(zorigin)
#> $center
#> [1] 0 0 0
#> 
#> $u
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    0    0    1
#> [2,]    0    1    0
#> [3,]    1    0    0
#> 
#> $d
#> [1] Inf Inf Inf
#> 
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "gell"

signature(dual(zorigin))
#>  pos zero  inf 
#>    0    0    3
```

#### Drawing generalized ellipsoids

The following figure shows views of two generalized ellipsoids.
*C*<sub>1</sub> (blue) determines a proper, fat ellipsoid; it‚Äôs inverse
*C*<sub>1</sub><sup>‚àí1</sup> also generates a proper ellipsoid.
*C*<sub>2</sub> (red) determines an improper, fat ellipsoid, whose
inverse *C*<sub>2</sub><sup>‚àí1</sup> is an unbounded cylinder of
elliptical cross-section. *C*<sub>2</sub> is the projection of
*C*<sub>1</sub> onto the plane where *z*‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ0. The scale of these
ellipsoids is defined by the gray unit sphere.
