Description: Represents generalized geometric ellipsoids with the "(U,D)" representation. It allows degenerate
	and/or unbounded ellipsoids, together with methods for linear and duality transformations, and for plotting.
	Thus ellipsoids are naturally extended to include lines, hyperplanes, points, cylinders, etc.
	This permits exploration of a variety to statistical issues that cen be visualized using ellipsoids
	as discussed by Friendly, Fox & Monette (2013), Elliptical Insights: Understanding Statistical Methods 
	Through Elliptical Geometry <doi:10.1214/12-STS402>.
