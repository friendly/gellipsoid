# gellipsoid: Generalized Ellipsoids 
<img src="man/figures/gellipsoid-logo.png" align="right" width="150px" />

The gellipsoid package extends the class of geometric ellipsoids to "generalized ellipsoids", which allow degenerate ellipsoids that are flat and/or unbounded. Thus, ellipsoids can be naturally defined to include lines, hyperplanes, points, cylinders, etc.
The methods can be used to represent generalized ellipsoids in a $d$-dimensional space
$\mathbf{R}^d$, with plots in up to 3D.

<!-- The motivation for this more general representation is to allow a notation for a class of generalized ellipsoids -->
<!-- that is algebraically closed under -->

The goal is to be able to think about, visualize, and compute a linear transformation of an ellipsoid with central matrix
$\mathbf{C}$ or its inverse $\mathbf{C}^{-1}$ which apply equally to unbounded and/or degenerate ellipsoids.
This permits exploration of a variety to statistical issues that can be visualized using ellipsoids
as discussed by Friendly, Fox & Monette (2013), _Elliptical Insights: Understanding Statistical Methods 
Through Elliptical Geometry_ <doi:10.1214/12-STS402>.

The implementation uses a $(\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{D})$ representation,
based on the singular value decomposition (SVD)
of an ellipsoid-generating matrix, $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{V}^{T}$,
where $\mathbf{U}$ is square orthogonal and $\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal.

For the usual, "proper" ellipsoids, $\mathbf{A}$ is positive-definite so all elements of $\mathbf{D}$ are positive.
In generalized ellipsoids, $\mathbf{D}$ is extended to non-negative real numbers, i.e. 
its elements can be 0, Inf or a positive real.

#### Definitions

A _proper_ ellipsoid in $\mathbf{R}^d$ can be defined by $\mathbf{E} := \{x \; : \; x^T \mathbf{C} x \le 1 \}$
where $\mathbf{C}$ is a non-negative definite central matrix, 
In applications, $\mathbf{C}$ is typically a variance-covariance matrix
A proper ellipsoid is _bounded_, with a non-empty interior.
We call these **fat** ellipsoids.

A degenerate _flat_ ellipsoid corresponds to one where the central matrix $\mathbf{C}$ is singular
or when there are one or more zero singular values in $\mathbf{D}$.
In 3D, a generalized ellipsoid that is flat in one dimension 
($\mathbf{D} = \mathrm{diag} \{X, X, 0\}$) collapses to an ellipse;
one that is flat in two dimensions ($\mathbf{D} = \mathrm{diag} \{X, 0, 0\}$)
collapses to a line, and one that is flat in three dimensions collapses to a point.

An _unbounded_ ellipsoid is one that has infinite extent in one or more directions,
and is characterized by infinite singular values in $\mathbf{D}$.
For example, in 3D, an unbounded ellipsoid with one infinite singular value is
an infinite cylinder of elliptical cross-section.

## Principal functions

* `gell()` Constructs a generalized ellipsoid using the $(\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{D})$ representation. The
inputs can be specified in a variety of ways:
  + a non-negative definite variance matrix;
  + an inner-product matrix
  + a subspace with a given span
  + a matrix giving a linear transformation of the unit sphere
  
* `dual()` calculates the dual or inverse of a generalized ellipsoid
* `gmult()` calculates a linear transformation of a generalized ellipsoid
* `signature()` calculates the signature of a generalized ellipsoid, a vector of length 3 giving the number of positive, zero and infinite singular values in the (U, D) representation.


* `ell3d()` Plots generalized ellipsoids in 3D using the `rgl` package

## Installation

You can install the `gellipsoid` package from CRAN as follows:

``` r
install.packages("gellipsoid")
```

Or, You can install the development version of gellipsoid from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("friendly/gellipsoid")
```

## Example

#### Properties of generalized ellipsoids
The following examples illustrate `gell` objects and their properties. Each of these may be plotted in 3D
using `ell3d()`.  These objects can be specified in a variety of ways, but for these examples the span
is simplest.

A unit sphere in $R^3$ has a central matrix of the identity matrix.
```{r ex1}
library(gellipsoid)
(zsph <- gell(Sigma = diag(3)))  # a unit sphere in R^3
signature(zsph)
isBounded(zsph)
isFlat(zsph)
```

A plane in $R^3$ is flat in one dimension.

```{r ex2}
(zplane <- gell(span = diag(3)[, 1:2]))  # a plane
signature(zplane)
isBounded(zplane)
isFlat(zplane)

dual(zplane)  # line orthogonal to that plane
signature(dual(zplane))

```

A hyperplane. Note that the `gell` object with a center contains more information than
the geometric plane.

```{r ex3}
(zhplane <- gell(center = c(0, 0, 2), 
                 span = diag(3)[, 1:2]))  # a hyperplane
signature(zhplane)

dual(zhplane)  # orthogonal line through same center

```

A point:

```{r}
zorigin <- gell(span = cbind(c(0, 0, 0)))
signature(zorigin)

# what is the dual (inverse) of a point?
dual(zorigin)

signature(dual(zorigin))

```

#### Drawing generalized ellipsoids

The following figure shows views of two generalized ellipsoids.
$C_1$ (blue) determines a proper, fat ellipsoid; it's inverse $C_1^{-1}$ also generates a proper ellipsoid.
$C_2$ (red) determines an improper, flat ellipsoid, whose inverse $C_2^{-1}$ is an unbounded cylinder of elliptical
cross-section.
$C_2$ is the projection of $C_1$ onto the plane where $z = 0$.
The scale of these ellipsoids is defined by the gray unit sphere.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```


This figure illustrates the orthogonality of each $C$ and its dual, $C^{-1}$. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
